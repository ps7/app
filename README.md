app.js - mobile webapps made easy
=================================

App.js is a lightweight JavaScript UI library for creating mobile webapps that behave like native apps, sacrificing neither performance nor polish.

* cross-platform (Android 2.2+, iOS 4.3+)
* themable platform-specific UI designs
* configurable native-like transitions
* automatically managed navigation stack
* built-in widgets for general use-cases

The goal of App.js is to provide a robust starting point for mobile webapps, handling general scenarios, and maintaining compatiblity with other common JavaScript libraries.
